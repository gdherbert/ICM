A JavaScript Interactive Campus Map for Northern Illinois University.

This code was written for the Spring 2013 GEOG790 Web Programming class while I was learning JavaScript, HTML, etc. It is a simple campus map using Leaflet for the map, OpenStreetMap for the data and the MapQuest and OverPass APIs for querying. It also loads a static JSON file as an example. It is hosted here for accessibility and learning purposes.

It has a permissive MIT licence, so do what you wish with it.
There are plenty of opportunities for refactoring and improving the code! I don't intend to pull changes back in at this stage as it isn't production code or code being worked on, but feel free to fork it and start your own branch for collaboration if desired.
